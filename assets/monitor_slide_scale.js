// Fits a slide into a box that is not the size of a screen.
//
// A slide's type is set in *points*, which are absolute: put the renderer into
// a smaller box and the words come out at their full size and overflow it. So
// the slide is laid out at the presentation's own size and the whole thing is
// shrunk with a transform — the same trick every other preview in Cantara
// uses.
//
// The factor cannot be worked out in Rust: the box is a share of a window
// whose size is the operator's business, and on the network a share of a phone
// nobody here can measure. It was CSS for a while —
// `scale(min(calc(100cqw / var(--slide-width)), …))` — which is exactly right
// and is dropped by any engine without container-query *division*. Cantara's
// own web view is one of them, and a dropped declaration means no scaling at
// all: the slide overflowed its box and the next one beside it was drawn at
// full size.
//
// So it is measured. This runs in two places and is one file for that reason:
// the window evaluates it when a slide frame mounts, and the page served to
// the network runs it after it has been given new markup. The arithmetic is
// the same arithmetic, and a second copy of it would be a second thing to get
// wrong.
