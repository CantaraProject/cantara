//! Cantara is an open source song presentation software that allows people to present song lyrics for a bigger audience to sing together.
//!
//! While the program was originally written in Free Pascal/Lazarus, this repository is a rewrite in Rust using Dioxus.
//!
//! # Structure
//! - The [main] function is the entry point for the program which handles the initializing and startup.
//! - Modules ending with `_components` contain the dioxus components used in the program and some helper functions used by the components
//! - The [logic] module provides the business logic of the program including repositories, settings and states.
//!
//! ## Additional crates
//! The parsing of the song files, the song structures and the side generation are part of the [cantara_songlib] crate.
//!
//! ## A rule the compiler keeps
//! Nothing outside the tests may `unwrap` or `expect`. A panic in a program
//! that is running a service is a black screen in front of a congregation,
//! and there is always something better to do with a failure: say it in the
//! panel, write it to the log, or carry on without the part that failed. The
//! lint below is what keeps that true as the program grows; tests are exempt,
//! where panicking *is* how a failure is reported.
//!
//! `deny` rather than `warn`, and Clippy is run in CI — see the "Check the
//! lints" step in `.github/workflows/dioxus.yml`. A warning is a rule nobody
//! keeps: `cargo test` does not run Clippy, so nothing failed when an
//! `unwrap` was added, and the note scrolled past in a build log that is
//! thousands of lines long.

#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used))]

// Make sure that no terminal window is shown on windows
#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]

        // helper wakes the task's `Waker`, and whether that reaches a
        // VirtualDom driven by a window's event loop is exactly the question
        // every other cross-window path in this program answers by polling
        // instead (see the loops in `PresentationPage` and
        // `PresenterConsolePage`). What the operator saw was a remote console
