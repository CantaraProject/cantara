//! Waiting, and what time it is — without a web view.
//!
//! Several views watch something that a background thread fills in — the
//! installed font families, the thumbnails of a library, a PDF page being
//! rendered — and a thread cannot write to a signal. So they look, wait a
//! moment and look again.
//!
//! That wait used to be `document::eval("await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r,
//! 150))")`: a script compiled and run in the page for every tick of every
//! poll. It works, but it makes the page the program's clock, it costs a
//! round trip through the web view each time, and it is a piece of JavaScript
//! in a place that needs none.
//!
//! Here it is a timer on the platform's own runtime instead. Every native
//! target already runs on tokio — Dioxus builds on it — and the browser has
//! `gloo-timers`, which is what wasm-bindgen's futures use anyway.
//!
//! [`Timestamp`] is here for the same reason: reading the clock is the other
//! thing whose answer depends on the target and not on the caller, and one
//! place that knows about `wasm32` is better than one in every module that
//! needs to know how long something has been going on.

/// A point on the wall clock, as milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

/// Deliberately not [`std::time::Instant`], which is the type this would
/// otherwise be. An `Instant` is a reading of a monotonic clock that means
/// nothing outside the process that took it, and every point that needs a time
/// here has to leave the process: to the helper that serves the network views,
/// to the browser tab the web build synchronises through, and to whatever
/// reloads and expects to be told the same number it was told before. None of
/// those can carry an `Instant`, and all of them can carry a count of
/// milliseconds.
///
/// The cost is the cost of a wall clock: it can be set backwards, by the user
/// or by NTP, and an elapsed time measured across that is wrong. So
/// [`elapsed_at`](Self::elapsed_at) saturates at zero rather than going
/// negative — a timer on a platform monitor that reads `0:00` for a moment is a
/// great deal better than one that reads something impossible, and a service is
/// not where a clock correction should produce a panic.
///
/// A whole number of milliseconds, and not an `f64`, for a reason that cost an
/// afternoon: **`serde_json` does not read floats back exactly.** Its default
/// parser is a fast approximation — exact round-tripping is behind the
/// `float_roundtrip` feature — so a timestamp of `1788605525443.4739` written
/// out came back as a *different* number, and a presentation compared against
/// the one that had just been sent to the helper was unequal to itself. It
/// failed in about one run of the test suite in three, which is the worst way
/// for a thing like this to fail.
///
/// An integer has none of that: JSON carries it exactly, on every path this
/// value takes. Nothing here wants sub-millisecond precision anyway — the
/// widget that reads it counts in seconds.
