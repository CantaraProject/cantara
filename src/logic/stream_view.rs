//! The second reading of the same service: what the network stream shows when
//! it is not simply showing the projection.
//!
//! A projector and a phone are not the same surface. A design built for a wall
//! ten metres away — a photograph behind it, forty-point type, two lines to a
//! slide — is not the one to read from a pew, and a congregation following on
//! their own screens can perfectly well be given the whole verse at once while
//! the wall goes two lines at a time. So both the design and the slide settings
//! may differ between the two, generally and song by song.
//!
//! The projection stays the reference. It is what the presenter console counts
//! in, what the moderator presses the button for, and what a slide number
//! means. The stream is a *second* set of slides over the same song, and every
//! slide of the projection is mapped to the one on the phone that shows it —
//! see [`map_slides`].
//!
//! That mapping is only well defined if a projection slide never straddles two
//! stream slides, which is what [`stream_slide_settings`] is for: a viewer's
//! slide has to hold a whole number of the projection's, or none of the rules
//! above hold. Everything here is pure and tested without a socket, a window or
//! a song file in sight.
