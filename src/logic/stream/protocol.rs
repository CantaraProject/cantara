//! What a browser on the network is told about the presentation.
//!
//! This is the whole agreement between Cantara and the page it serves, and it
//! is deliberately *data* rather than a rendering. A phone is not a projector:
//! it is held upright, it is a fifth of the size, and a picture of a 16:9 slide
//! is unreadable on it. Sending what the slide *says* lets the page set it in
//! the design's colours and fonts at a size that suits the screen it is on.
//!
//! It also carries the **whole running order**, not only the slide that is up.
//! Two views are planned that need exactly that — a stage view, which shows
//! what is coming as well as what is showing, and a running-order sheet, which
//! is the entire service scrolled through in one page — and neither should
//! need a protocol of its own. What is up now is [`StreamState::position`]; the
//! rest is already there.
//!
//! Everything here is pure: it is built from a [`RunningPresentation`] and
//! turned into JSON, and both halves can be tested without a browser or a
