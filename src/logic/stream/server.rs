//! The HTTP server that offers the presentation to the network.
//!
//! It runs on a Tokio runtime of its own, on a thread of its own. The window
//! must not be able to stall it and it must not be able to stall the window —
//! a viewer whose phone went to sleep mid-song is not a reason for a slide
//! change to wait, and a slow slide change is not a reason for a viewer to be
//! dropped.
//!
//! What passes between the two is one [`watch`] channel carrying the current
//! [`StreamState`], and one map of pictures. The program writes; every viewer
//! reads. Nothing is polled: a viewer's connection sleeps until the state it
//! is watching changes, which is what makes a slide change appear on a phone
//! at the same moment it appears on the wall.
