//! Getting a video file into the page that draws the presentation.
//!
//! A picture from the library travels into the page as a `data:` URL — read,
//! base64-encoded and pasted into the markup. See [`crate::logic::images`].
//! That cannot be done with a video, for two reasons that both matter:
//!
//! * A service video is tens or hundreds of megabytes, and base64 makes it a
//!   third larger again. Building that string blocks whatever thread it happens
//!   on and the result has to be held in memory twice over.
//! * A `data:` URL cannot be seeked into. The whole thing has to arrive before
//!   anything can be played, and jumping to the middle means decoding
//!   everything before it. A presenter jumping to a position is exactly what
//!   the console is for.
//!
//! So the file is *served* instead, and the web view fetches the parts it wants
//! with range requests, as it would from any web server. On the desktop that
//! server is [`dioxus::desktop::use_asset_handler`], which answers requests
//! from the page's own origin without a socket being involved.
//!
//! Except on the WebKitGTK platforms, which will not play media from the
//! custom URI scheme the page itself is served from — there the same bytes go
//! over a socket on the loopback interface instead. Both servers answer with
//! [`answer_video_request`], so what is sent is the same either way; which of
//! them a slide asks is the difference between [`video_url`] and
//! [`video_source_url`], and the reason is in [`crate::logic::video_server`].
//!
//! The path is carried in the URL rather than in a table of open files, so a
//! window that is opened later — the projection, the presenter console — can
//! resolve a slide it was handed without asking anyone first.

// twice, tens of milliseconds apart — which is not a doubled volume but a
// flanging echo, and it is worse than either window alone.

// when there is one: that is where the operator is, it is where the controls
// are, and it is the window whose sound card is wired to the hall. Where there
// is no console the projection owns it, because otherwise nothing would.
