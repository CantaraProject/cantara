//!
//! The counterpart to [`crate::logic::network_server`], which explains why
//! that is a process of its own. This half is what the two switches in the
//! presentation options talk to: it starts the helper, tells it what to offer,
//! hands it the presentation and the pictures whenever they change, applies
//! what a remote operator does, and stops it again.
//!
//! Both services — the stream to the pews and the console — are one helper on
//! one port. Either switch starts it; the last one to go off stops it.
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort by design. A helper that will not start is
//! reported to the user and changes nothing else; a helper that dies mid
//! service takes the remote console with it and leaves the projection exactly
//! as it was. The presentation is the main window's, and nothing in this file
//! is allowed to be a reason for it to stop.
