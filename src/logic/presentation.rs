#author: John Newton

Amazing grace
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost
but now am found,
was blind, but now I see

It was grace that tought
my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved:
how precious did that
grace appear the hour
I first believed.

How sweet the name
of Jesus sounds
in a believer's ear.
It soothes his sorrows,
heals the wounds,
and drives away his fear.";
