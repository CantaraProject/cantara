//! A typed model of a PowerPoint deck, and the bridge to
//! [PptxGenJS](https://gitbrent.github.io/PptxGenJS/) that writes the file.
//!
//! # Why a wrapper
//!
//! Writing OOXML from Rust would mean re-implementing a large, fiddly format.
//! PptxGenJS already does it and runs in the same webview Cantara draws its
//! presentation in, so the file can be produced on the client with no server
//! and no extra native dependency.
//!
//! What is *not* delegated is the decision of what goes on a slide. That lives
//! here, in plain Rust data that can be unit-tested without a browser:
//!
//! ```text
//! Cantara slides + design  ──►  PptxDeck  ──►  JSON  ──►  PptxGenJS  ──►  .pptx
//!        (Rust)                  (Rust)                     (JS)
//! ```
//!
//! The JavaScript side is deliberately dumb: it walks the JSON and calls
//! PptxGenJS, without knowing anything about songs, slides or fonts. Every
//! decision worth testing is therefore testable here.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! PptxGenJS positions everything in inches. A 16:9 deck is 13.333 × 7.5 in,
//! which is what [`PptxDeck::widescreen`] sets up. Font sizes are in points, as
//! in PowerPoint itself.
