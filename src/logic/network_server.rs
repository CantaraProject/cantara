//! Cantara's network side: one process, one socket, both services.
//!
//! A browser on the hall's network reaches the presenter console here, and so
//! does a phone in a pew reaching the stream. They are one address and one
//! port because they are one server — the viewer's routes come from
//! [`crate::logic::stream::server`] and are merged with the console's onto the
//! same listener.
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything. What is offered, to whom, and what there is
//! to show all arrive over a socket from Cantara itself; this process serves
//! them. See [`crate::logic::network_host`] for the other half.
//!
//! # Why a process of its own
//!
//! Because `dioxus_html` keeps *one* event converter for the whole process —
//! `EVENT_CONVERTER`, a global — and the two renderers disagree about what an
//! event is. `dioxus_desktop` installs a converter that reads a mounted
//! element as its `DesktopElement` and a form event as its `DesktopFormData`;
//! `dioxus_liveview::LiveViewPool::new` overwrites it with one that reads the
//! same events as its own types. Neither tolerates the other's: both
//! `unwrap()` the downcast, in a place that cannot unwind.
//!
//! In one process the last one installed wins and the other aborts the
//! program. Cantara's own crash was the plainest possible version of it —
//! creating the pool switched the converter, the main window mounted an
//! element, and the process died at `events.rs:91`.
//!
//! So the console runs where nothing has installed a desktop converter: a
//! second copy of this binary, started with `--remote-console`, which never
//! calls [`dioxus::launch`] and therefore never gets one. It holds no state of
//! its own — it is given the presentation over a socket and sends back what
//! the operator does with it, which is the bridge in
//! [`crate::logic::remote_console`] with a process boundary in the middle.
//!
//! # What it is given
//!
//! Nothing on the command line but a port and a token, because a command line
//! is readable by everything on the machine. It connects to the parent on the
//! loopback interface, proves it is the child that was started, and is then
//! told which port to serve on and what password to ask for. The same
//! reasoning, and the same shape, as [`crate::logic::video_server`].
