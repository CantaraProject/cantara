//! That is the same presentation read differently, and this module is the
//! different reading.
//!
//! Nothing here controls anything. A monitor view receives the presentation
//! and draws it; the one place a service is driven from is the presenter
//! console. A stage monitor that could be leant on would be a second one, and
//! two people who can both press "next" is a bug report waiting in a service.
