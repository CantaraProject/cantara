//! One rendering, two surfaces: turning a presentation into HTML that a phone
//! on the network can be shown.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Cantara used to draw a slide twice. The window drew it with the components
//! in [`crate::components::presentation_components`]; the page served to
//! browsers drew it again, in JavaScript, from a description of the slide that
//! [`crate::logic::stream::protocol`] built for it. Two renderers of the same
//! thing, and the second one only ever knew about the features the first had
//! when it was written — which is exactly how a monitor design came out as a
//! plain wall of text on a phone. Its layout and its widgets were not missing
//! from the data; the page simply had no idea such things existed.
//!
//! So the page stops rendering. What it is given is HTML produced by *the same
//! components the projector uses*, through [`dioxus_ssr`]. A feature added to
//! a slide, a design, or a monitor layout reaches the network by existing.
//!
//! # Why here and not in the helper
//!
//! Cantara's network side runs as a second process — see
//! [`crate::logic::network_server`] — and the obvious place to render would be
//! there, next to the socket. It is the wrong place, for two reasons that both
//! come down to the helper deliberately knowing nothing:
//!
//! * **The pictures.** A slide's background and a picture slide are inlined as
//!   data URLs out of [`crate::logic::images`], whose cache is filled from the
//!   library on disk. The helper has neither the library nor the cache; it is
//!   handed rendered bytes and serves them. Cantara has both, warm, because it
//!   is already showing the same slide on the projector.
//! * **The settings.** Which design a view is shown in is a setting, and the
//!   helper has no settings — by design, so that a service cannot be changed by
//!   whatever reaches the socket.
//!
//! Rendering here also keeps the fan-out that made the stream a static page in
//! the first place: the slide is rendered **once per change**, not once per
//! viewer, and the same bytes go to every phone in the building. That is what
//! ruled out giving each viewer a `dioxus-liveview` session the way the remote
//! presenter console has one — a console is one operator, a stream is the whole
//! congregation, and a server-side `VirtualDom` per phone is a different
//! proposition entirely.
//!
//! # What a caller has to know
//!
//! [`render_presentation`] is synchronous and does no I/O of its own beyond the
//! picture cache it reads. It builds a `VirtualDom`, renders it once, and drops
//! it — so anything a component does in an effect or a spawned task has *not*
//! happened. In practice that means:
//!
//! * A picture that is not in the cache yet renders as no picture, and the next
//!   render — after it has been prepared — has it. Nothing waits.
//! * Time-based widgets read the clock at the moment of rendering. They are as
//!   fresh as the last render, which is why anything showing one has to be
//!   re-rendered on a timer rather than only when the slide changes.
